# C_ProgrammingBasics
 Basics Fundamentals of Programming in C Lang.
 

## Getting Started

Programs build on Basic C/C++ lang. Clone the project and run on your local machine for development and testing purpose. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

C/C++ compiler 32/64 bit based on your system processesor
Recommended IDE:
* Visual Studio Code
* DEV C++

### Installing
1.Visit the Visual Studio Code website to download the latest version of Visual Studio Code.
2.You should see your computer’s operating system displayed, but if it’s not correct, click on the down arrow and find the option that matches your operating system from the drop down menu and click on the down arrow icon under “Stable.”

Windows users: This will download the latest version of Visual Studio Code as an .exe file.

Mac users: This will download the latest version of Visual Studio Code for Mac as a .zip file.

Linux users: .deb and .rpm are different file types for storing data. We suggest you download the .deb file so auto-updates work as the Visual Studio Code documentation suggests.

3.Once the Visual Studio Code file is finished downloading, we need to install it. Find the Visual Studio Code file in your file manager, the program that lets you see the files and folders on your computer.

Windows users: Open the .exe file by clicking on it and on run the installer. Keep clicking ‘Next’ and then finally ‘Finish.’

Mac users: The downloaded .zip file should be in your ‘Downloads’ folder. Open the file. If you see this message choose “Open.”

Linux users: The downloaded file should be in your ‘Downloads’ folder.

Find it in your file manager, double click and choose ‘Install’ in the GUI software center, or run the following commands, one at a time, in the terminal:

4.Make sure you have your Visual Studio Code application save4d in a place you know you will easily be able to find it.

Windows users: It will automatically be placed in your Start menu.

Mac users: Click and drag the Visual Studio Code icon from the Downloads folder to the Applications folder.

Linux users: It should appear in your task bar of programs.
